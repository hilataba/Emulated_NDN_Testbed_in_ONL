# exp1 - monitor ndn-traffic during a link failure
=============
drop all packets between WU-->UIUC and measure pkt count on WU-->UIUC and WU-->UM to monitor ndn traffic :
	WU-->UIUC  28x1-->30x1
	WU-->UM    28x1-->21x1

scenario: 
cd ../configuration
./runAll.sh (start nfd and nlsr on all routers)

cd ../Demo_Files
./populateVMs.sh (copies traffic conf files to Vms)

cd ../Retransmission_Files

ssh $SWR1631 sudo ./add_filter.sh 

./flipLinks.sh <exp_name> (drops and adds the link between WU-->UIUC and measure the pkt coounters to monitor ndn traffic. results are saved under results/raw_data/<exp_name>)
